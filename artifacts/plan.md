### Layout Implementation Options

- **Flexbox vs. Grid:**
  - **Flexbox** is suitable for the header and features section due to its one-dimensional layout capabilities.
  - **CSS Grid** could be used for the overall page layout to manage the positioning of sections.
  
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Use media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes, especially for mobile devices.

- **Background Shapes:**
  - Use CSS for the abstract shapes, possibly with `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements for layering.
